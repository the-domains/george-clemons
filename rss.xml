            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 heralds beginning of the "megatall" skyscraper era</h1><p>The number of skyscrapers over 600 metres high - known as "megatalls" - is set to more than double in the next few years, say experts. Skyscraper authority the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has revealed that the number of 600-metre-plus buildings in the world is set to rise from three to seven in the next five years.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6162d7ae66c7c63eb63d77e497ca469c/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.dezeen.com%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F01%2FThe-Kingdom-Tower_Adrian-Smith_Gordon-Gill-Architecture-_dezeen_social.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote. In other words, it's the first remote to understand where it is in your home and what it's pointing at, allowing users to simply point and click to control devices instead of switching between apps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df1caa77bd36920224edf22d445e863c5b829e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Granted, it was the car park beneath Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners' award-winning Neo Bankside development, and the other bays were full of Ferraris, Maseratis and other exotic metal.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e9722ec934a561a202db1ac3eff4119777420ed.jpg"></article>]]></description>
