            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote. In other words, it's the first remote to understand where it is in your home and what it's pointing at, allowing users to simply point and click to control devices instead of switching between apps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df1caa77bd36920224edf22d445e863c5b829e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Clever Headrest That Could Make Flying Actually Bearable</h1><p>There are many reasons to hate flying economy. The tiny seats, the inedible food, the fees airlines charge for things you'd get for free in a medieval dungeon. Manon KÃ¼hne can't fix any of that, but she's has found one small way to make sitting in 17C just a bit less hellish.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8dc283ca637a9ed4e81f27749130ffccde596046.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rising dawn: Rolls-Royce debut handsome new soft-top.</h1><p>The Rolls-Royce Dawn made its debut in an underground car park, just a stone's throw from Wallpaper's HQ. Granted, it was the car park beneath Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners' award-winning Neo Bankside development, and the other bays were full of Ferraris, Maseratis and other exotic metal.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e9722ec934a561a202db1ac3eff4119777420ed.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside the Stunning Mansion in Ex Machina</h1><p>There are many stunning, otherworldly sights in Ex Machina, the science-fiction film directed by Alex Garland that features a robot so lifelike she's played by actress Alicia Vikander. But the most breathtaking sight of all may be the 100 percent real, available-for-a-night's-stay location where the film is set: the Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/681669ff82d513a623869d49c9b8fe8ee3c88229.jpg"></article>]]></description>
