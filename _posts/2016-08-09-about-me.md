# About Me

Working in the field of communications, and participating in the evolution of technology that is making a difference in people's lives, is what motivates George. His consultative selling and account management style sets even the most stressed-out CIO at ease. He is their trusted adviser, and also works on a daily basis with CEOs, CTOs, IT directors and IT managers from small and large companies to help them increase their business' productivity.

George's experience heading up his own company for many years gives him an in-depth understanding of what it's like to own and operate a company. With this knowledge in hand, he helps his customers with everything from the smallest details to very complex and customized unified communications solutions. These small and large technology solutions have included: business phone systems -- hosted and on-premise solutions using pure voice-over IP or local dial tone; unified communications; design and deployment of SMB networks; multiple location integration; Efax; contact center solutions; IP telephony consulting; video collaboration; CRM integration; predictive dialers; and more.
